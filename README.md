When the user presses enter, the time at which they scanned is saved in the time stamp file. The count number of people in the gym goes up with each press. The user can press "q" to close the gym. 

The user can press "nm" for new member and create a new account with their name and age. An ID will be assigend randomly to them. They can sign in with their ID and the number of people in the gym will be tracked. When a person signs in they are added to a queue and when they have been there for over an hour they will be removed. Pressing "p" prints to file all members in order of ID number and pressing "c" prints all current people in the queue.

I've also added a visual crown meter that outputs a "*" to represent 1 person signed in. The crown meter text file shows each minute for presentation purposes so you can see the number of people in the gym. In a real situation, this file would be incremented by each hour. Pressing "t" will print out the total number of people who scanned into the gym that day.

Next big steps for this project would be to use a website or app developer to switch the program to a more user friendly interface. This would also allow the crowd meter to be shown with better graphs and visuals as opposed to using the stars. The last step for this project would then be to figure out how to integrate the program with real scanners and Wake Forest IDs.
