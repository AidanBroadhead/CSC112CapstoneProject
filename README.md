When the user presses enter, the time at which they scanned is saved in the time stamp file. The count number of people in the gym goes up with each press. The user can press "q" to close the gym. 

For this milsetone, I added a Member class that will store name, age, and ID number of members at gym. I also added a sorting method for sorting members by ID number in the future. I also created a file that will store the sorted member info. I added skeloton of classes that will be able to add and remove members to the member list.
